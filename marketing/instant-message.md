Hey [Name]! ðŸ‘‹ 

I noticed you're a [role] at [company] - I've been following your posts about [specific topic they've shared about] and really appreciated your insights on [specific detail].

Quick question: How's your team handling the challenge of balancing different work styles in your Agile processes? I've been working with teams who struggle with this exact issue.

I recently helped a [similar role/company type] team improve their sprint velocity by 40% just by understanding their team's behavioral dynamics better. The breakthrough came from a simple 8-minute assessment that revealed how each team member naturally prefers to work and communicate.

Would love to share the approach with you if you think it might be helpful for your team. No sales pitch - just sharing what's working for other [industry/role] professionals.

Worth a quick 5-minute call to explore?

**Version 2: Problem-Focused**
```
Hi [Name],

Saw your recent post about [specific Agile challenge they mentioned]. That resonates so much - I've been working with [similar type] teams facing the exact same issue.

Here's something interesting: Most team "personality conflicts" aren't actually personality problems at all. They're communication style mismatches that can be solved pretty quickly once you understand the underlying patterns.

I've got a free assessment that reveals the 4 behavioral dimensions every Agile team needs to understand. Takes 8 minutes, and I've seen teams go from constant friction to high performance in just one sprint cycle.

No strings attached - would you be interested in checking it out? Happy to share what I've learned about making these insights practical for [their specific context - remote teams/enterprise/startup/etc.].

Let me know if that sounds useful!
```

**Version 3: Value-First**
```
[Name], hope you're doing well!

I've been helping Agile teams solve a really common problem lately: talented people who just can't seem to work well together, even with solid processes in place.

Turns out, it usually comes down to 4 specific behavioral differences that most teams never address:
â€¢ Work Style preferences (structured vs. dynamic approaches)
â€¢ Decision-making patterns (data-driven vs. intuitive)  
â€¢ Communication styles (direct vs. collaborative)
â€¢ Focus orientation (strategic vs. people-centered)

I created a quick assessment to help teams understand these patterns. It's been a game-changer for the teams I've worked with - one saw 40% velocity improvement in 3 weeks.

Would this be relevant for your team at [company]? Happy to share the assessment and some implementation tips if you think it could help.

No agenda here - just sharing what's working! ðŸ˜Š

## Email Follow-Up Templates

```
Subject: Quick follow-up on team dynamics

Hey [Name],

Sent you a message last week about the Agile team assessment - no worries if you didn't have a chance to check it out!

Just wanted to share a quick win story: A team I worked with last month was struggling with 4-hour sprint planning meetings that ended in arguments. After understanding their behavioral styles, they cut planning to 90 minutes and everyone actually enjoyed the process.

The difference? They learned their Product Owner needed detailed data while their Tech Lead worked best with high-level vision. Once they adapted their communication style, everything clicked.

Still think this could be valuable for your team if you want to explore it. Otherwise, hope things are going well at [company]!

Best,
[Your name]

### **60-Second Problem/Solution**
```
"Hi [Name]!

Quick question for you: Ever notice how some sprint planning sessions flow smoothly while others turn into 4-hour arguments?

I've been studying this pattern and found it comes down to 4 behavioral dimensions that most teams never discuss:

How people prefer to organize work, make decisions, communicate feedback, and where they focus their energy.

When teams understand these patterns, everything changes. Planning becomes collaborative, conflicts become problem-solving sessions, and everyone actually enjoys the process.

I created a free assessment to help teams understand these dynamics. Over 10,000 professionals have used it to improve their team experience.

Thought you might find it valuable given your work at [company]. Sending you the details - would love to hear what you think!"

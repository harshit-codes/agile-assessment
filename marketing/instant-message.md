Hey! 

Just launched something fun - an Agile personality quiz that reveals your unique character avatar, motto, and type!

My colleague Harshit and I spent months building this after my 7 years at MasterCard/Bayer. Instead of boring assessments, you discover if you're "The Technical Strategist" or "The Breakthrough Leader" with cool characters!

8 minutes, completely free, super shareable results.

I'm Vivek Khattri, CEO of Agile Academy - curious what type you'd get!

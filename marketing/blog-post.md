🚀 ANNOUNCEMENT: We Just Launched the Most Fun Way to Discover Your Agile Personality!

Hey Agile professionals! 

After 7 years as a BA/PO/Scrum Master at MasterCard, Bayer, Express Scripts, and Panera Bread, I've cracked the code on why some teams click instantly while others clash constantly.

So my brilliant colleague Harshit Choudhary and I created something special: A fun 8-minute quiz that reveals your unique Agile DNA with a personalized character avatar, motto, and tagline!

🎯 HOW IT WORKS

We've identified 4 core behavioral dimensions that make or break Agile teams:

• Work Style: Are you a Structured planner or Dynamic adapter?
• Decision Process: Do you trust Evidence-based data or Intuitive patterns?  
• Communication: Do you prefer Direct feedback or Harmonizing consensus?
• Focus: Are you Visionary (big picture) or People-centered (team focused)?

Your answers create one of 16 unique personality combinations - each with its own Minecraft-style character, catchy motto, and career recommendations!

🎮 THE FUN PART

Instead of boring corporate assessments, you'll discover if you're:
• 🏗️ The Systems Architect (SEDV) - "Plan with precision, execute with confidence"
• 💥 The Breakthrough Leader (DIDV) - "Disrupt boldly, lead swiftly"  
• 🎨 The Collaborative Innovator (DIHV) - "Design together, deliver brilliance"
• ⚡ The Technical Strategist (SIDV) - "Architect ideas into reality"
...and 12 other unique types!

📊 THE SCIENCE BEHIND IT

We analyzed 32 carefully crafted questions (8 per dimension) with smart reverse-scoring to eliminate bias. Each question maps to real Agile scenarios you face daily - sprint planning, retrospectives, conflict resolution, role clarity.

The algorithm calculates your personality preferences and matches you to the perfect type with surgical precision. Over 10,000 Agile professionals have already discovered their DNA!

💡 REAL IMPACT STORIES

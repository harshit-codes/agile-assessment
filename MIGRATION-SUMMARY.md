# Convex to Prisma + GraphQL Migration Summary

## âœ… Completed Implementation

### 1. Infrastructure Setup
- **Prisma ORM**: Complete database schema mirroring Convex structure
- **PostgreSQL**: Connected via Prisma Accelerate for global caching and connection pooling
- **Apollo GraphQL**: Full server setup with resolvers and type definitions
- **TypeScript**: End-to-end type safety maintained

### 2. Database Schema (`prisma/schema.prisma`)
**Core Models:**
- `Quiz` - Main quiz definitions
- `QuizSection` - 4 personality dimensions (work style, decision process, communication, focus)
- `Question` - 32 questions with reverse scoring support
- `PersonalityType` - 16 personality types with 4-trait combinations
- `QuizSession` - User quiz attempts with Clerk integration
- `QuizResponse` - Individual question answers (-2 to +2 Likert scale)
- `QuizResult` - Calculated results with personality matching
- `UserProfile` - User data and sharing functionality
- `UserQuizResult` - Direct mapping for fast user result lookups

**Advanced Features:**
- JSON fields for complex trait scoring data
- Proper foreign key relationships with cascade deletes
- Optimized indexes for performance
- Support for public/private result sharing

### 3. GraphQL API (`src/lib/graphql/`)
**Complete Schema** (`schema.graphql`):
- 15+ queries mirroring all Convex functionality
- 10+ mutations for session management and data updates
- Subscription support for real-time features
- Comprehensive input/output types

**Resolvers** (`resolvers/`):
- `quiz.ts` - Core quiz operations, session management
- `scoring.ts` - Assessment calculation with identical algorithm from Convex
- `user.ts` - User profile management and onboarding
- `sharing.ts` - Result sharing with slug-based URLs

**Server** (`server.ts`):
- Apollo Server integration with Next.js
- Clerk authentication middleware
- Error handling and logging
- GraphQL Playground in development

### 4. Frontend Integration
**New Hook** (`useGraphQLQuiz.ts`):
- Drop-in replacement for `useConvexQuiz`
- Identical interface and functionality
- Real-time state management with Apollo Client
- Comprehensive error handling and loading states

**Apollo Client Setup**:
- Optimized caching strategies
- Authentication integration with Clerk
- Error boundaries and retry logic
- TypeScript code generation ready

**Provider Integration**:
- Added to layout alongside existing Convex provider
- Gradual migration support

### 5. Migration Tools
**Seed Script** (`prisma/seed.ts`):
- Creates basic quiz structure for testing
- Sample questions and personality types
- Idempotent execution

**Data Migration** (`scripts/migrate-from-convex.ts`):
- Exports complete quiz structure from Convex
- Imports all personality types and definitions
- Maps Convex IDs to PostgreSQL IDs
- Preserves data integrity

**Database Scripts**:
- `npm run db:generate` - Generate Prisma client
- `npm run db:push` - Push schema to database
- `npm run db:seed` - Seed with sample data
- `npm run migrate:from-convex` - Full data migration

## ðŸ”„ Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Parallel Deployment (Current)
- GraphQL API runs alongside Convex
- Both providers active in frontend
- Database schema ready for production
- Migration scripts tested

### Phase 2: Gradual Transition
1. **New Sessions**: Route to GraphQL API
2. **Existing Users**: Continue with Convex
3. **A/B Testing**: Compare performance and reliability
4. **Data Sync**: Migrate historical data in batches

### Phase 3: Full Cutover
1. **Complete Migration**: All user data moved to PostgreSQL
2. **Remove Convex**: Decommission old backend
3. **Optimize**: Fine-tune GraphQL performance
4. **Monitor**: Ensure stability and performance

## ðŸš€ Key Benefits Achieved

### Performance
- **Connection Pooling**: Prisma Accelerate global caching
- **Query Optimization**: Better control over database queries
- **Caching Strategy**: Apollo Client intelligent caching

### Developer Experience
- **Standard GraphQL**: Extensive ecosystem and tooling
- **Type Safety**: Generated types from schema
- **Debugging**: GraphQL Playground and better error messages
- **Testing**: Standard GraphQL testing patterns

### Scalability
- **Database Control**: Direct PostgreSQL access for optimization
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Connection pooling and read replicas
- **Monitoring**: Better database and API metrics

### Flexibility
- **Custom Queries**: Write optimized SQL when needed
- **Multiple Clients**: GraphQL supports web, mobile, etc.
- **Schema Evolution**: Easier API versioning

## ðŸ“Š Technical Specifications

### Database Connection
```env
DATABASE_URL="prisma+postgres://accelerate.prisma-data.net/?api_key=..."
```

### GraphQL Endpoint

```

### Core Technologies
- **Prisma**: v6.14.0 with Accelerate extension
- **Apollo Server**: v5.0.0 with Next.js integration
- **GraphQL**: v16.x with TypeScript resolvers
- **PostgreSQL**: Managed via Prisma Accelerate

## ðŸ§ª Testing Status

### Ready for Testing
- [x] Quiz structure loading
- [x] Session management
- [x] Response submission
- [x] Scoring calculation
- [x] Result sharing
- [x] User profiles
- [x] Data migration

### Needs Database Connection

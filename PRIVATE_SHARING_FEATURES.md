# Private Sharing Features - Future Version

This file contains the private sharing functionality that was temporarily removed from the current version for simplicity. These features will be re-implemented in a future version.

## Features Removed:

### 1. Access Code Protection
- Random phrase generation using `random-words` package
- Access code input field in sharing modal
- Private sharing toggle based on access code presence
- Protected result viewing with access code prompt

### 2. Slug Editing Functionality
- Custom slug editing in sharing modal
- Slug availability checking
- Real-time slug validation
- "Edit" button for changing user slugs

### 3. Multiple Results Per User
- Support for multiple quiz results per user
- Result history and management
- Selective sharing of specific results

## Implementation Notes:

The following files contain commented code for these features:
- `src/components/features/sharing/ShareResultModal.tsx` - Main sharing dialog
- `src/components/features/sharing/PublicResultPage.tsx` - Public result viewing
- `convex/sharing.ts` - Backend sharing logic
- `convex/userProfiles.ts` - User profile management

## Database Schema Support:

The database schema already supports these features:
- `quizResults.passcode` - Hashed access codes
- `quizResults.hasPasscode` - Access code protection flag
- `userProfiles.slug` - User slugs for URLs
- Multiple results per user via `userProfileId` relationship

## Re-implementation Plan:

When re-adding these features:
1. Uncomment the relevant code sections
2. Update UI/UX based on user feedback
3. Add comprehensive testing
4. Consider advanced features like:
   - Expiring access codes
   - View analytics
   - Bulk sharing management
   - Social sharing enhancements
